🚴‍♂️ CitiBike Data Analysis with Weather Integration 🌦️

Welcome to the CitiBike Data Analysis project! This repository contains data processing, aggregation, and visualization tasks to analyze CitiBike trip data alongside weather conditions. The project leverages Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Kepler.gl to uncover insights into bike-sharing patterns in NYC.

📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on:

✅ Loading and cleaning CitiBike trip data and weather data 📂

✅ Aggregating trip counts between start and end stations 🚲

✅ Visualizing data using Kepler.gl interactive maps 🌍

✅ Applying filters to highlight key trends and busiest routes 🔍

✅ Extracting insights about station usage, peak routes, and weather influence 🌡️
